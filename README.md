🧠 How It Works
The user starts with a default balance of 2000 PKR.
Every time the user adds an expense:
The expense name and amount are added to the list
Total expenses are updated
The remaining balance decreases
If the user tries to spend more than the available balance,
An alert appears saying “Insufficient Balance”
The user can delete any expense to restore the balance.
